# Lab Prerequisites
To complete the exercises in this lab you will need to be working from a development environment that has the following tools installed and functional.

*Example List*

* [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)
* [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org)
* [Cisco NSO](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/#!getting-nso)
* [Python 3.6+](https://python.org)
* [IOS XE 16.9.1 Vagrant Box](https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog/tree/master/box_building#cisco-csr-1000v)

# Lab Environment Setup
Complete these steps after installing the prerequisites to setup the environment for this workshop.

> "Setup" is expected to be completed in advance of the actual lab by the instructor to complete time consuming steps.  

1. Clone the sample lab code down to your workstation.  And change to the lab directory.  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hpreston/workshops
    cd workshops/sample
    ```

1. Run `./setup.sh` to initialize the lab environment.  This will do the following:
    * Create Python virtual environment, activate, and install requirements
    * Suspend any running VirtualBox VMs
    * Start Vagrant Environment
    * Suspend Vagrant Environment

# Lab Start
When ready to run this lab, follow these steps.  

1. Run `source start` to prepare the workstation.  This will do the following:
    * Activate the pre-create virtual environment
    * Resume the Vagrant Environment
    * Open the Lab Guide in an Incognito Chrome Window
    * Open Webex Teams Developer Page in Incognito Chrome Window Make

# Lab Cleanup
After running the lab, follow these steps to reset the environment to potentially `setup` and `start` again.  

1. Run `./cleanup.sh` to fully reset the environment.  The following will be done:
    * Destroy the Vagrant Environment
    * Delete the Python 3 Virtual Environment.
